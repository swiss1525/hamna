      Hi love, <br />It's me Dario. Well I'm writing this paragraph on a site
      lol. I hope you like it. I just wanna say that I love you so much and I
      wanna thank you for the 9 months we've been together. They've been the
      best for real. I don't think it would be as nearly the same if you hadn't
      come into my life. I hope you'll have a successful life ahead of you and I
      wanna be part of your success and even your fails because I wanna be part
      of your life every step of the way. There's not a single doubt in my mind
      telling me that I shoudldn't be with you. I wanna be with you and I wanna
      live a life with you. I wanna go on an adventure with you. I wanna create
      moments only you and I can experience. My promise to you, and I know I'll
      keep this promise, I'll make sure you'll have the best life you deserve.
      I'll give you all the chocolates, all the noodles, all the love,
      everything your heart desires, I'll do my very best to meet those desires.
      At the end of the day, I wanna see that beautiful smile of yours light up
      the whole universe and see you fall into my arms. There's nothing that
      will complete my life than you marrying me. When you accepted me into your
      life, you gave me this hope that I've been holding onto since then and
      I'll keep on holding on to that hope until I can't no more. My love, your
      smile, your laugh, your eyes, your personality, they're what makes me fall
      in love with you every day. I can't get enough of you. I didn't think I'd
      fall in love with someone this hard but you made me believe love is true
      as long as you find the right person. You are the perfect person. You are
      my perfect girl. The one and only Hamna. I can't wait to add my last name
      to yours. I choose you and I will always choose you. No other girl can
      convince me otherwise because you're so unique and special to my heart, no
      one can touch you. I wanna say to our kids that finding true love is hard,
      but in the end, the reward is so grand and worth it. Until we can finally
      see eye to eye, I will take our moments online and cherish them and keep
      them safe in my heart. Our moments won't ever be recreated with someone
      else my love. I don't wanna experience love with anyone else. I know say
      that many times but I just wanna remind you that you're the only person
      who is worth fighting for. So yeah :> I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
